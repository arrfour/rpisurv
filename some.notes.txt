Some Notes
# RTSP addresses REQUIRE port explicit in config "/etc/rpisurv"
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x/h264" will NOT work but
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x:554/h264" will work

For full screen, single viewer, set nr_of_columns: "1"

        #An Example Cam
        - rtsp_url: "rtsp://10.50.20.40:554/h264"
