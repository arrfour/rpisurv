Some Notes
# RTSP addresses REQUIRE port explicit in config "/etc/rpisurv"
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x/h264" will NOT work but
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x:554/h264" will work

Multiple Screen Observations------------------------------------------------------------------
My use called for a single camera so for full screen, single viewer, set nr_of_columns: "1"
My test used an older display which had issues showing more than 3 sources.

        #An Example Cam
        - rtsp_url: "rtsp://10.50.20.40:554/h264"
        
        
I'm having consistent issues displaying 2 columns of streams to a 1080p display. I can display 2x1 (columnxrow) of 1080p stream with no issue, but any additional beyond a single column results in "out of range" or "standby mode" on the display via both HDMI and DVI testing.
If I explicitly edit my "/boot/config.txt" with the following to force 720p, everything works as expected.

# manual hdmi display mode
#hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080
#hdmi_group=2
# explicit 1920x1200 at 60hz
#hdmi_mode=68
# explicit 720P
#hdmi_mode=85
# explicit 1080p
#hdmi_mode=82
