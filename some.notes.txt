Some Notes
# RTSP addresses REQUIRE port explicit in config "/etc/rpisurv"
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x/h264" will NOT work but
    - rtsp_url: "rtsp://x.x.x.x:554/h264" will work

Multiple Screen Observations------------------------------------------------------------------
My use called for a single camera so for full screen, single viewer, set nr_of_columns: "1"
My test used an older display which had issues showing more than 3 sources.

        #An Example Cam
        - rtsp_url: "rtsp://10.50.20.40:554/h264"
        
        
I'm having consistent issues displaying 2 columns of streams to a 1080p display. I can display 2x1 (columnxrow) of 1080p stream with no issue, but any additional beyond a single column results in "out of range" or "standby mode" on the display via both HDMI and DVI testing.
If I explicitly edit my "/boot/config.txt" with the following to force 720p, everything works as expected.

# manual hdmi display mode
#hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080
#hdmi_group=2
# explicit 1920x1200 at 60hz
#hdmi_mode=68
# explicit 720P
#hdmi_mode=85
# explicit 1080p
#hdmi_mode=82

What Is the Stream URL for OpenEye IP Cameras?
It is possible to connect to OpenEye IP cameras using third party software like VLC media player (http://www.videolan.org).

To connect some types of software will need to know the stream URL. All OpenEye IP cameras are capable of delivering two RTSP streams, as well as streaming MJPEG over HTTP. The stream URLs are listed below.

rtsp://<ip address>/jpeg

rtsp://<ip address>/mpeg4

rtsp://<ipaddress>/h264 - Stream 1

rtsp://<ipaddress>/h264_2 - Stream 2

rtsp://<ipaddress>/h264_3 - Stream 3

http://<ipaddress>:8008

The MJPEG over HTTP stream is identified by a port number. The default port is 8008; this port can be configured in the cameras Network page.
